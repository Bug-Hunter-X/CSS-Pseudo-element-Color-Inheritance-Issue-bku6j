The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a pseudo-element (::before) is unexpectedly not inheriting the color style from its parent element. This behavior is non-standard and can lead to unexpected visual results.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent::before {
  content: "Hello";
}
```

In this scenario, the expectation is that the pseudo-element `::before` inherits the `color: blue` style from the parent. However, in some browsers or scenarios, it might render as the default text color (black) instead.

This issue is more likely to appear with particular CSS declarations and certain browser versions.  It can be particularly challenging to debug because the behavior is inconsistent across different implementations.
